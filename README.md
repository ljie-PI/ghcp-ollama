# GHC Gateway

GHC Gateway is a loopback-only GitHub Copilot gateway with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama-compatible APIs. It runs as one Node.js process and includes a local Admin UI for account, model, runtime configuration, history, usage, and operational-event management.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.20.0 or newer
- A GitHub Copilot subscription
- Windows x64, Linux x64/arm64, or macOS x64/arm64

Storage uses Node.js built-in SQLite. Neither package installation nor source installation requires Python or a local C++ compiler. SQLite's version follows the installed Node.js release; no extra runtime flags are required. Earlier Node.js 24 releases are not supported because Windows file-identity differences can prevent secure daemon startup.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --global @ljie-pi/ghc-gateway
```

The package installs one executable: `ghcg`.

To build and run a source checkout, use Node.js 24.20.0 or newer:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

`npm start` runs the built gateway in the foreground. Pass startup options after `--`, for example `npm start -- --port 31401`.

## Start The Gateway

Run in the foreground:

```bash
ghcg serve
```

Or start one detached, self-managed daemon:

```bash
ghcg start
ghcg status
ghcg restart
ghcg stop
```

The listener is always `127.0.0.1`. The default port is `31400`. A different startup port can be selected only for `serve` or `start`:

```bash
ghcg serve --port 31401
ghcg start --port 31401
```

There is no watchdog, automatic restart, operating-system service installation, or second server process. Stop and restart verify the daemon PID, operating-system process start identity, instance nonce, and authenticated control endpoint before termination.

## Authentication And Accounts

Start GitHub.com device authorization:

```bash
ghcg auth login
```

Start authorization for GitHub Enterprise Server:

```bash
ghcg auth login --host github.example.com
```

Other account commands:

```text
ghcg auth login poll <flow-id>
ghcg auth logout [--account <account-id>]
ghcg auth status
ghcg accounts list
ghcg accounts use <account-id>
ghcg accounts remove <account-id>
```

Management commands are authenticated clients of the running gateway. They never open its SQLite database or credential file in a second process. If the gateway is not running, start it with `ghcg start` or `ghcg serve` first.

## Models

```text
ghcg models list [--account <account-id>]
ghcg models current
ghcg models set <model-id>
```

Preferred models are account-specific. If a catalog refresh removes a preferred model, it is marked invalid and must be explicitly reselected. The gateway never silently selects the first model.

## Admin UI

```bash
ghcg admin open
```

This requests a one-use, 60-second bootstrap token through authenticated local control and opens it in the URL fragment. The browser exchanges it for an in-memory Admin Session; the token is removed from the URL and is not stored in browser storage.

Admin security defaults:

- HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict session cookie scoped to `/admin`
- 30-minute idle expiry and 12-hour absolute expiry
- exact loopback Origin and CSRF validation for mutations
- sessions invalidated when the gateway restarts
- bounded, replayable SSE monitoring with no WebSocket or remote Admin access

The six views are Overview, Accounts, Models, Configuration, Responses History, and Events.

## HTTP Interfaces

All routes use the same loopback listener. Inference routes do not require a separate gateway API key in this release.

| Method | Route | Interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses, native or Chat bridge |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | OpenAI models; Anthropic shape with `anthropic-version` |
| `POST` | `/api/chat` | Ollama Chat |
| `GET` | `/api/tags` | Ollama model listing |
| `GET` | `/api/version` | Ollama-compatible version probe |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Process liveness |
| `GET` | `/readyz` | Runtime readiness |
| `GET` | `/admin/*` | Admin static application |

No unversioned, compact, trailing-slash, or legacy route aliases are registered.

## Configuration

Global options:

```text
--data-dir <path>
--json
```

Startup configuration applies only when the process starts. Priority is CLI, then environment, then default.

| Setting | CLI | Environment | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Port | `--port` | `GHC_GATEWAY_PORT` | `31400` |
| Data directory | `--data-dir` | `GHC_GATEWAY_DATA_DIR` | `~/.ghc-gateway` |
| Log level | `--log-level` | `GHC_GATEWAY_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` |

Runtime configuration is stored in SQLite. Environment values seed a missing database row once; later starts use the persisted values. Read or update it through:

```text
ghcg config get [key]
ghcg config set <key> <value>
```

| Runtime key | Default | Range |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `limits.requestBodyBytes` | 33554432 | 1048576..67108864 |
| `limits.sseEventBytes` | 4194304 | 65536..16777216 |
| `limits.nonstreamBodyBytes` | 33554432 | 1048576..134217728 |
| `limits.accumulatorBytes` | 33554432 | 1048576..134217728 |
| `admission.activeMax` | 4 | 1..16 |
| `admission.queueMax` | 16 | 0..64 |
| `timeouts.queueMs` | 30000 | 1000..300000 |
| `timeouts.connectMs` | 30000 | 1000..120000 |
| `timeouts.firstByteMs` | 120000 | 5000..600000 |
| `timeouts.streamIdleMs` | 120000 | 5000..600000 |
| `timeouts.totalMs` | 1800000 | 60000..7200000 |
| `accounts.maxAuthenticated` | 8 | 1..32 |
| `history.ttlDays` | 7 | 1..365 |
| `usage.retentionDays` | 90 | 1..365 |
| `events.retentionDays` | 7 | 1..30 |

The corresponding one-time seed variable uses the `GHC_GATEWAY_` prefix and upper snake case, for example `GHC_GATEWAY_LIMITS_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`.

## Local Data And Privacy

The default data directory is `~/.ghc-gateway` and contains:

- `state.db` with runtime settings, account metadata, bounded Responses History, usage buckets, and sanitized operational events
- `credentials.json` with protected credentials
- `daemon.json` with protected process identity and local-control authentication
- `logs/*.jsonl` with bounded, sanitized daemon logs

Credentials and daemon identity use protected atomic files. Prompts, responses, tool arguments, authorization values, and complete upstream error bodies are not persisted in telemetry or exposed by Admin errors.

Responses History stores only completed bridge checkpoints, at most 512 responses, with a seven-day default TTL. Usage is content-free and retained for 90 days by default. Operational Events retain at most 512 sanitized entries for seven days by default.

## Existing Installations

The switch to Node.js built-in SQLite preserves the current `state.db` and `credentials.json` files. It requires no database reset, export/import, or reauthentication. Older, incompatible gateway data layouts and process state are not imported. No compatibility executable, environment, data-path, or runtime fallback aliases are provided.

## Automation

Every command accepts `--json` and writes one compact success or error object. Human successes go to stdout and errors go to stderr.

```bash
ghcg --json status
ghcg --json accounts list
ghcg --json config get limits.requestBodyBytes
```

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run smoke:sqlite
npm test
npm run fixtures:verify
npm run e2e
npm run bench -- full --repeat 3
npm run pack
```

Automated tests are offline and use scripted GitHub/Copilot remotes. Official-client suites are manual release evidence and require explicit opt-in:

```bash
GHC_GATEWAY_SDK_TESTS=1 npm run test:sdk
GHC_GATEWAY_LIVE_TESTS=1 npm run test:live:sdk
```

The live suite can contact real GitHub Copilot and must not be run as part of normal development or CI. Set `GHC_GATEWAY_LIVE_CHAT_MODEL`, `GHC_GATEWAY_LIVE_VISION_MODEL`, and `GHC_GATEWAY_LIVE_REASONING_MODEL` to verified shared Chat models for their respective scenarios. Set `GHC_GATEWAY_LIVE_RESPONSES_MODEL` to a verified native Responses model, or set `GHC_GATEWAY_LIVE_NATIVE_RESPONSES_NOT_AVAILABLE=1` only after verifying that the current account catalog has no native-capable model.
