# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: use `gh issue list` with the appropriate state/label filters and JSON output.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply/remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.**

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs. Resolve a bare `#42` with `gh pr view 42`, then fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Skill operations

- "Publish to the issue tracker" means create a GitHub issue.
- "Fetch the relevant ticket" means run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.
- `/wayfinder` uses a `wayfinder:map` issue and linked child issues; native GitHub sub-issues and dependencies are preferred, with task-list and `Blocked by:` fallbacks.
